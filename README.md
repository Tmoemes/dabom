# Installation and Assembly Guide

## Disclaimer

The project was created by a team of students under the Adaptive Robotics minor at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. The goal of the project was to create a plug-and-play introduction to ROS 2 Humble and mobile robotics. By following the guide, anyone should be able to create their own holonomic platform and install all the necessary programs to create a map of the environment and autonomously navigate within the map.

## Hardware Guide

### 3D Printed Parts

All the 3D models are located inside the `CAD` folder. For 3D printing, use the `.stl` file format. You may use Fusion 360 to open the individual components and save them as `.stl`. STL (Standard Triangle Library) files are the most commonly used file format for 3D printing. These files need to be sliced by slicing software before the 3D printer can interpret them. For slicing, Cura slicer is recommended with the following print parameters:

| Print Parameters          | Value                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Material                  | Generic PLA                            |
| Print Temperature         | 205Â°C                                  |
| Print Speed               | 50 mm/s or less (aim for good quality) |
| Layer Height              | 0.1 or 0.12 mm                         |
| Wall Count                | 3                                      |
| Bottom and Top Wall Count | 8                                      |
| Infill                    | 20% gyroid                             |
| Build Plate Adhesion      | Brim (recommended)                     |

For printing, Ultimaker and Bambu Lab printers were used. These printers provide high quality; however, they are not mandatory for the project since the plastic parts are plenty strong by themselves.

For the mechanical assembly, a full CAD assembly is provided, which can be used as a reference.

### Electrical Components

All the necessary components are listed in the BOM (Bill of Materials) Excel file. A possible vendor is provided, but you are free to source the components from anywhere. It is important to mention that the Lidar used for this project, RPLidar model A2M8, is currently discontinued. The alternative A2M12 requires changes to the code. These changes are not implemented in the current working repository! The implementation of the A2M12 model is only recommended for experienced ROS users.

### Electrical Schematics

For the wiring of the power lines it is recommended to use the 0.5mm gauge wires with Farrell connectors on the end to make connections more safe and reliable. 
For details regarding the Arduino check [Arduino Wiring Schematics](Arduino_Code/README.md).


## Software Guide

### Computer Side
On the computer you want to install Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS. For a guide how to install Ubuntu follow the link: [Install Ubuntu Guide](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu/)Additionally it is recommended to download the Raspberry Pi etcher tool and use that instead of Rufus or Balena etcher since that tool will be necessary later for the Raspberry Pi imaging.

First we need to install git
```bash
sudo apt install git
```
Now we can go ahead and download the git

**Follow here from the Raspberry Pi**
The first step is to clone the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tmoemes/dabom.git
```
Now that the GitHub is cloned we can show the folder and navigate within it. 

**It is important to install ROS 2 Humble which you can do by follow this guide [ROS Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) .  Make sure you install the desktop version on both.**

After which we need to install additional components for the system so run the following command: 
```bash
cd dabom
bash install.sh
```
During the installation prompts will pop up, by pressing enter you can continue the installation. Once it is done it is recommended to add the following line to the last line of the .bashrc file. 
```bash
ls -a 
nano .bashrc
```
and add the following line to the end of the text:
```bash 
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

Once that is done we are going to navigate into the project and Colcon build it. Colcon building will make sure that the code is built into a ROS package, that can be run. Optionally a parameter could be added to the Colcon build, this way the project does not need to be recompiled after every change of the code.  
```bash 
cd dabom/dabom_ws
colcon build 
```
Optional:
```bash
cd dabom/dabom_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
```

After the build is finished you want to source the install file of the project. Make sure you are in the `dabom_ws` folder.
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Optionally you may also add this line to the `.bashrc` file. Just make sure you add the full location. Which means the line will look like this:
```bash
source dabom/dabom_ws/install/setup.bash
```
**End Raspberry Pi installation here**

Now we need to edit the startup file. Navigate to `dabom/dabom_ws/src/dabom_bringup/config` and edit the following file `/launch_config.yaml`. There you may enable or disable certain parts of the system. For example you may disable the external control input for the movement of the robot.

Now we can run the code on the computer side
```bash
ros2 launch dabom_bringup computer_bringup.py
```


### Raspberry Pi Side
[Ubuntu Installation Guide For Windows](https://roboticsbackend.com/install-ubuntu-on-raspberry-pi-without-monitor/)
Follow the installation manual and install Ubuntu Server 22.04.5 LTS onto an SD card. During the installation make sure that SSH is enabled. Make sure to remember the password! You can do this by overwriting the setting before installation. Further more make sure the Wi-Fi details are set to the address of a Wi-Fi network that both the computer/laptop and the Raspberry Pi will be connected to. For the Wi-Fi network it is possible to use a home router or a mobile hotspot with internet access enabled.  Once the installation is done plug in the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and provide power to the system.

Now connect your Ubuntu device to the same Wi-Fi network. Now it is necessary to figure out the IP address of the Raspberry PI. [How to discover devices on network?](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/scan-for-network-devices)
Now connect to the raspberry pi via SSH:
```bash
sudo ssh nameofthepi@ipaddress
```

Example:
```bash
sudo ssh pi@192.168.91.2
```

Now that we are in the Raspberry Pi terminal follow the same instructions as the Computer side.  

Before running the programs we have to make sure that the program has access to the serial ports, both for the lidar and the serial communication. Here make sure that the Lidar is plugged into ttyUSB0. On the Raspberry Pi that port is the top USB port furthest away from the Ethernet connector. 
For the Lidar:
```bash
cd src/rpldiar_ros/
source scripts/create_udev_rules.sh
```
For the serial communication:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ttyS0.rules
```
paste the following text into the file:
```
KERNEL=="ttyS0", MODE="0666"
```
Then reload the udev rule set.
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

If this would not work for some reason you may also run the following commands as a backup:
```bash
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyS0
```

Now that the permissions are settled we can proceed with the launching of the robot software! Furthermore for some reason TAB auto complete is not working on the following command.
```
ros2 launch dabom_bringup rpi_bringup.py
```
If no error is returned the robot code should be up and running, you may exit the code any time by pressing `Ctrl + C` .
